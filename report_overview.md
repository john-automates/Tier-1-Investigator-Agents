## Cybersecurity Investigation Overview: Suspicious software.exe Execution

**1. Executive Summary:**

This report analyzes a security incident involving the execution of a suspicious file, "software.exe," on a Windows host. The investigation involved decoding a Base64-encoded PowerShell script, analyzing the file's hash on VirusTotal, investigating the associated IP address and domain, and searching for related threat reports. The analysis reveals a high likelihood of malicious activity, given the high VirusTotal detection rate and the obfuscated nature of the PowerShell script used for download and execution.  Further investigation is warranted to determine the exact nature of the threat and its impact.

**2. Key Findings:**

* **Malicious PowerShell Script:** A Base64-encoded PowerShell script was discovered.  The decoded script downloads "software.exe" from `anigame.gg`, calculates its SHA256 hash, compares it to a hardcoded value, performs a quick scan with Windows Defender, and then executes the file silently if the hash matches. The use of obfuscation and a hash check suggests an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution of a specific version of the malicious software.
* **High VirusTotal Detection Rate:** The file hash (SHA1: 1d31bd48b2e864c773ca6a3b9fd0019416809066) has a high detection rate (65/78) on VirusTotal, strongly indicating malicious intent.
* **Suspicious Domain:** The domain `anigame.gg` used to host the malicious file returned no results in reputation checks, possibly indicating a newly registered domain specifically for malicious purposes or a domain with a very low profile.
* **Limited IP Information:** While the IP address 13.224.189.18 was flagged for investigation, the OSINT investigation yielded limited direct information about it. The provided report shows an error in processing this IP address for reputation and geolocation. However, the subsequent search for threat reports linked the IP to `cdn.boomtrain.com`, a domain located in the United States. This connection requires further scrutiny.
* **Potentially Related Software:**  A search for "software.exe" yielded a discussion about "OneLaunch" software and its potential malicious nature. This might be a coincidence, but warrants further investigation to rule out any connection.

**3. Potential Threats:**

* **Malware Infection:** The high VirusTotal detection rate and the surreptitious nature of the PowerShell script strongly suggest that "software.exe" is malware.  The specific type of malware is unknown but could range from ransomware, spyware, or a botnet client.
* **Data Breach:** Depending on the malware's functionality, sensitive data could be exfiltrated from the infected host.
* **System Compromise:** The malware could compromise the host system, allowing attackers to gain control and potentially use it for further malicious activities.
* **Lateral Movement:**  The compromised host could be used as a pivot point for attacks on other systems within the network.

**4. Recommended Actions:**

* **Isolate the Infected Host:** Immediately isolate the infected host from the network to prevent further spread of the malware.
* **Full System Scan:** Conduct a thorough scan of the infected host using multiple reputable antivirus and anti-malware solutions.
* **Memory Forensics:** Perform memory forensics to identify any running malicious processes and further analyze the malware's behavior.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic logs to identify any communication between the infected host and external servers. This can help determine command and control infrastructure and data exfiltration.
* **Domain and IP Investigation:** Conduct a deeper investigation into the domain `anigame.gg` and the IP address 13.224.189.18 using various threat intelligence platforms and tools.  Focus on identifying any related infrastructure and past malicious activity.
* **Block the Malicious Domain and IP:** Block the domain `anigame.gg` and the IP address 13.224.189.18 at the firewall and other network security devices to prevent further infections.
* **Review Security Controls:** Review existing security controls and identify any weaknesses that allowed the malware to bypass defenses.  Implement necessary improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.
* **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of downloading and executing files from untrusted sources and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.

**5. Conclusion:**

The evidence strongly suggests a malware infection facilitated by a sophisticated PowerShell script. The investigation revealed several key indicators of compromise, requiring immediate action to contain the threat and mitigate potential damage. Further investigation is crucial to fully understand the scope and impact of the incident and to improve security posture against future threats.  The lack of clear information on the domain and IP address highlights the need for more robust threat intelligence gathering and analysis.
